# 👋 Hi, I’m @sChatzikostas
- 👀 **I’m interested in...**  
  Building scalable backend systems, taming databases with SQL, and optimizing performance like a chef perfecting a recipe. I enjoy designing secure APIs, role-based access control (RBAC) systems, and highly analytic platforms that crunch numbers like it’s cardio.  

- 🌱 **I’m currently learning...**  
  Advanced FastAPI magic, multi-tenant architectures, and how to avoid deploying updates right before dinner.  

- 💞️ **I’m looking to collaborate on...**  
  Backend projects with a love for analytics, automation, and anything database-heavy. If it involves solving tricky problems and writing clean code, count me in!  

- 📫 **How to reach me...**  
  Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sotiris-chatzikostas) or drop me an email; carrier pigeons are not yet supported.  

- 😄 **Pronouns:**  
  He/Him  

- ⚡ **Fun fact:**  
  I designed an automated accounting system and a multi-restaurant management platform, and somehow I’m still finding edge cases that defy all logic. Also, my logging system is so detailed it could probably write its own memoir.  

### 💻 Tech I Work With  
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Frameworks/Tools:** FastAPI, MySQL (raw queries only!), DBeaver, PyCharm, Linux  

- **Current Deployment:**  
  Built and deployed backend systems on Linux servers with **cron jobs**, a custom **supervisor process manager**, and a **logging and update system** so robust it feels like having a live narrator for the apps.  
  Implemented **role-based access control (RBAC)** and multi-company user management to keep data secure and admins sane. The systems generate everything from trial balances to balance sheets and help track finances, income, costs, and expenses in real-time.
